- Added settings to play adhan only on certain days (like play Dhuhr on Sundays and not the other days)

- Fixed reminders (they should work more reliably now)
- Allow reminders to play custom sound
- Added option to show/play reminder only once
- Added option to change the secondary calendar
- There's a change to settings internally, no problem should occur during the update, but if you decided to use an older version after updating, you will lose your reminders.
- App will now always open fullscreen alarm when adhan is playing when you open the app
- Fullscreen alarm behavior is improved, which may also reduce battery usage of the app a little bit
- App respects DnD settings now
- Reduced app size even more!
- Improved app startup performance
- Minor tweaks and improvements
